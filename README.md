## Deployment

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on
our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original
repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub
   Repository](https://github.com/niclastanskanen/project-5-api)
1. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings"
   Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
1. Click the button (not the number to the right) and you should now have a copy
   of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

**NOTE**: It is a requirement of the project that you have Python version 3.8 or higher installed locally.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/niclastanskanen/project-5-api).
1. Under the repository name, click "Code".
1. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.
1. Open your local terminal with git installed
1. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
1. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    ```console
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/niclastanskanen/project-5-api
    ```

1. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/niclastanskanen/project-5-api
    > Cloning into `test-dir`...
    > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
    > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
    > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
    > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
    ```

    [Click here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) for a more detailed explanation of the process above with pictures.

1. Change the current working directory to the cloned project folder (this will be a child directory in the location you cloned the project).

1. This guide assumes you have Node.js and npm installed locally, if this is not the case please install these now.
1. From the terminal run the command `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
1. Run the command `npm start` to run the application.

### Deploying with Heroku

**NOTE**: It is a prerequisite of deployment to Heroku that you already have access to the following:

**NOTE**: It is assumed you have followed all deployment instructions listed in this readme starting with the section titled 'Forking the GitHub Repository'.

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and if not taken there automatically, navigate to your personal app dashboard.
2. At the top of the page locate the 'New' drop down, click it and then select 'Create new app'.
3. Give your application a unique name, select a region appropriate to your location and click the 'Create app' button.
4. Your app should now be created. From the menu towards the top of the page select the 'Settings' section and click 'Reveal Config Vars' in the Config vars section.
5. Navigate to the 'Deploy' page using the menu towards the top of the page.
6. Select 'GitHub' from the 'Deployment method' section and you will be prompted to 'Connect to GitHub'.
7. Once connected to your GitHub account you will be able to search for your repository which contains the forked 'SnapTapApp' repository.
8. Once the repository is found click 'Connect'.
9. At the bottom of the page find the section named 'Manual deploy', select the 'main' branch in the drop down and click the 'Deploy' button.
10. Once deployment is complete, click the 'View' button to load the URL of the deployed application.

### Linking with the API/backend

You will need to ensure you have set the `axios.defaults.baseURL` in the `api/axiosDefaults.jsx` file to the url of your deployed version of th API.
You should then update the `CLIENT_ORIGIN` config variable in your deployed version of the API to ensure you will be able to make authenticated requests to this API.
